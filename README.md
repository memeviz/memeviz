## Problem Statement
Memes communicate ideas and/or behavior that spread throughout a culture. Images with text overlay provide infinite ways to generate and express information. They have rapidly grown in popularity on the internet in recent years, appearing frequently on social media platforms such as Facebook and Reddit.

For people with avid interest in memes and those who casually view them, there is currently a disconnect of information between memes and their value. There are no formal definitions for what makes a meme popular, how a meme goes viral, or how original a meme is. Lastly, meme culture is constantly changing and it can be hard to keep up with the changing definitions and trends.
